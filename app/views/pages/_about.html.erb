          As a child I always wanted to be an inventor and now follow my dream by building meaningful code. I write readable and maintainable code that that implements good practices. I thrive in picking up new skills and technologies at a very fast pace and am a true team player. Although I value my contributions as an independent worker, I care more about the mission trying to be achieved and succeeding as a team. I communicate with clarity and empathy with everyone I work with and give feedback that is Actionable, Specific and Kind.
